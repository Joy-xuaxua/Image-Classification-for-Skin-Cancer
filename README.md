# Image-Classification-for-Skin-Cancer

Trained and fine-tuned a model using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture to classify skin cancer into eight classes.

Implemented under-sampling for majority class and SMOTE for minority classes to balance the dataset, improving model performance.

Applied custom class weights in the cross-entropy loss function to address class imbalance, enhancing model accuracy.

Achieved a validation accuracy of 0.6925 and strong AUC scores of 0.9450. Demonstrated effective class discrimination and robust classification performance, especially in underrepresented classes.
